# DiseasePrediction
Disease Prediction Application Using Machine Learning

The project involves disease prediction using machine learning algorithms. Data understanding, preprocessing, cleaning and visualization steps were implemented. Overlap was examined. Hyperparameter adjustments to KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Naive Bayes algorithms were applied with grip search and cross validation, and predictions were made in a loop. Times were measured. And the application gave the classification report of the machine learning algorithm selected according to the most accurate hyperparameter, time and accuracy.
